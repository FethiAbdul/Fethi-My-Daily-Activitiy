# Time Management Analysis using R: A Self-Study on Daily Activities

## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed self-study aimed at analyzing time management across two semesters (Semester 1 and Semester 2) as a full-time student and part-time worker. By collecting data on activities such as study hours, sleep hours, and email activity, the study seeks to identify patterns, evaluate consistency, and assess differences between semesters. Leveraging the capabilities of R and RStudio, this analysis utilized statistical methods and advanced data visualization techniques to generate actionable insights for improving daily routines and achieving a better work-life balance. The use of R and its libraries provided a robust framework for data manipulation, hypothesis testing, and visualization, making it a critical tool for this personalized analysis.

## Methods Used

### **1. Descriptive Statistics**
- Calculated measures like mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals for:
  
### **2. Data Visualization**
- Created insightful visualizations to understand trends and distributions:
  - ![Histogram for Study Hours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FethiAbdul/Fethi-My-Daily-Activitiy/main/hist.png): Reveals a unimodal distribution with a slight negative skew.
  - ![Boxplot for Study Hours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FethiAbdul/Fethi-My-Daily-Activitiy/main/boxplot.png): Highlights data symmetry with no visible outliers.
  - ![Bar Chart for Study Hours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FethiAbdul/Fethi-My-Daily-Activitiy/main/bars.png): Compares study hours day-by-day between the two semesters.
  - ![Line Plot for Study Hours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FethiAbdul/Fethi-My-Daily-Activitiy/main/test.png): Shows fluctuations in study hours over 10 days for both semesters.

### **3. Hypothesis Testing**
- Conducted one-sample and two-sample t-tests to evaluate:
  - Whether study hours differ from expected averages.
  - Differences in study habits between Semester 1 and Semester 2.
  - Example: A paired t-test for the first 10 days of both semesters found no statistically significant difference in study hours.

### **4. Comparison Between Semesters**
- Created subsets for Semester 1 and Semester 2 to analyze and visualize trends.
- Plots were used to illustrate daily variations and overall consistency in study routines.
